Here are the lists of useful tutorials, mostly are about array and sequencing analysis. And I will update it when I am available.

## Bioinformatics
+ [Bioinformatics Team of U Texas](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/bioiteam/Home), wide topics included, need some understanding of what you want to learn.
+ [UC Davis Bioinformatics Training Program](http://training.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/documentation/). NGS, array, and R. I suggest this [data analysis and visualization course](http://training.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/docs/2012/05/DAV/index.html), focusing on bioinformatics analysis by R.
+ [A microarray course from MD Anderson](http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/main/Education:MicroarrayCourse) (last updated in 2010).
+ [HOMER](http://homer.salk.edu/homer/index.html). Yes, HOMER is an NGS software. But the authors do really provide great toturials about NGS, covered most fields.
+ [Slides of workshop lecutures from BioTech Institute of Cornell](http://cbsu.tc.cornell.edu/workshops.aspx). About Linux, programming, and of course, NGS.
+ [Statistical Bioinformatics](http://www.stat.usu.edu/jrstevens/stat5570/) provided by John R. Stevens of Utah State University.
+ [Learn about Bioinformatics and Computational Tools for Biology](http://jura.wi.mit.edu/bio/education/), some lectures from Whitehead Institute of MIT. Some contents are at [submenu](http://jura.wi.mit.edu/bio/education/hot_topics/). I found this page because I found they provided a [lecture](http://jura.wi.mit.edu/bio/education/hot_topics/ngsplot/ngsplot_Apr2014.pdf) for our ngs.plot.
+ [A bioinformatics tutorial](http://compbio.ucdenver.edu/Hunter_lab/Phang/downloads/index.html) provided by Assotiate Professor Dr. Tzu Lip Phang from UC Denver.
+ [CUBELP2](http://elvis.misc.cranfield.ac.uk/CUBELP2/). Dr Robert King's collection about bioinformatics tutorials, :-)
+ [RNA-seqlopedia](http://rnaseq.uoregon.edu/) A good resource for RNA-seq.

## Genetics & Genomics
As I was trained in evolutionary genetics (of primates), I am always interested about the topics in this fields.

+ [Human genetics course from Mark Batzer's lab of LSU](https://biosci-batzerlab.biology.lsu.edu/course.html). 
+ [Introduction to Statistical and Computational Genomics](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~ruzzo/courses/gs559/09wi/), from William Noble of Washington University, based on Python.

## Computer science, statistics, or other

### Machine learning
+ [Free book: An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/), another book (for entry level) of the authors of the famous book [The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/).
+ [Free book: Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/), written by Michael Nielson.
+ [Free book: A Course in Machine Learning](http://ciml.info/), written by [Hal Daum√© III](http://hal3.name/).
+ [Data mining](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/datamining/) (in R) course from Ryan Tibshirani of CMU.
+ [Free book: Probabilistic Programming & Bayesian Methods for Hackers](http://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/), mainly written by Cam Davidson-Pilon.
+ [Introduction for Machine Learning](http://courses.washington.edu/css490/2012.Winter) A course provided by J. Jeffry Howbert of Washington University.

### R
+ [Free book: R cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/), written by Winston Chang.
+ [Computing with data](http://www3.nd.edu/~steve/computing_with_data/), provided by Steven Buechler, University of Notre Dame.

### Misc
+ [Free book: Probabilistic Models of Cognition](https://probmods.org/), written by Noah D. Goodman and Joshua B. Tenenbaum.
