Recently, two commentary articles about careers of a postdoc/bioinformatician published in *Nature*.

One's title is ["Core services: Reward bioinformaticians"](http://www.nature.com/news/core-services-reward-bioinformaticians-1.17251), discussing the dilemma bioinformaticians are facing in academic fields.

Another one's title is ["The future of the postdoc"](http://www.nature.com/news/the-future-of-the-postdoc-1.17253), focusing on the problems of the postdocs.

Both articles just described the problems I'm facing as a postdoc/bioinformatician.
