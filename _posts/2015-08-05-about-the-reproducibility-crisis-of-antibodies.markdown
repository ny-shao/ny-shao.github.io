[A piece of *Nature* news](http://www.nature.com/news/reproducibility-crisis-blame-it-on-the-antibodies-1.17586#/) complained the reproducibility of the antibodies. Yes, the quality of antibodies already became a nightmare of the wet lab biologists, literally, really one of my colleagues said he suddenly woke in midnight, because he worried the specificity of the key antibodies he used in his projects.

In this news, the author listed some websites related to antibodies:

+ [Antibodypedia](http://antibodypedia.com/)
+ [Antibodies-online](http://www.antibodies-online.com/)
+ [Antibody Registry](http://antibodyregistry.org/)
+ [pAbmAbs](http://pabmabs.com/wordpress/)

Recently *Molecular cell* also published a [paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276515004943) announced an online histone antibody [database (http://www.histoneantibodies.com/)](http://www.histoneantibodies.com/). But the problem is that until now the website is still "404" page.
